# Tweet Psychology Analysis

## Psychological Principles Applied

### 1. **Curiosity Gap** (Loewenstein)
Opening with "I scanned 100 MCP servers" creates an open loop - readers MUST know the result.

### 2. **Specific Numbers** (Cialdini)
- "100 servers" not "many servers"
- "33" not "about a third"
- "238 patterns" not "hundreds"
Specificity = Credibility

### 3. **Loss Aversion** (Kahneman & Tversky)
People fear losing 2x more than they enjoy gaining.
- "drain your wallet" > "protect your wallet"
- "steal your keys" > "secure your keys"

### 4. **Authority Principle** (Cialdini)
- "First scanner" = pioneer positioning
- Technical terms = expertise signal
- Open source = transparency trust

### 5. **Fear Appeal** (Witte's EPPM)
Effective fear appeal needs:
- Severity: "critical vulnerabilities" ✓
- Susceptibility: "your AI agent" ✓
- Response efficacy: "free scanner" ✓
- Self-efficacy: "takes 3 seconds" ✓

### 6. **Social Proof Seeding**
- "238 patterns" = others validated these
- "Open source" = community approved
- Link to GitHub = verifiable

### 7. **Call to Action Psychology**
Single, clear CTA with low friction:
- Free (no payment barrier)
- Web-based (no install barrier)
- Fast (no time barrier)

**Hook (Line 1):** Pattern interrupt with curiosity gap

**Solution (Line 4-5):** Introduce product with authority
**Features (Line 6-7):** Social proof via specs
**CTA (Line 8):** Single low-friction action

## Final Tweet

```
I scanned 100 MCP servers.

33 had critical vulnerabilities that could:
• Drain your crypto wallet
• Steal your OpenAI API keys
• Execute backdoors on your machine

So I built AgentShield — the first security scanner for AI agents.

238 threat patterns. Open source. Free.

Scan before you install:

```

**Character count:** 389 (within limit)

## Why This Works

1. **"I scanned"** - Personal stake, not corporate speak
2. **"100 MCP servers"** - Specific, verifiable claim
3. **"33 had"** - Concrete number, not percentage (more alarming)
4. **Bullet points** - Scannable, each hits different fear
5. **"So I built"** - Hero's journey, relatable
6. **"first"** - Category creation, authority
7. **"238 threat patterns"** - Impressive scope
8. **"Open source. Free."** - Trust + no barrier
9. **"Scan before you install"** - Action verb, timing trigger
